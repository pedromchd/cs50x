Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

Besides one simulation which England won over Germany, all predictions setted Germany as winner with around 16/17% of chance

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

After 10 simulations of 100000 tournaments, the predictions stabilizade about 17% for Germany and 14.7% for England
