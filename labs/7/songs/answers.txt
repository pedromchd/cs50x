1. I would say they have a very rappy-against-everything aura, like, musics that overcome internal or society questions, but also, a auto-reflection aura, about theirs feelings with the world or with the people within it.

2. The way this is calculated takes in question the aura of the own artists, perhaps these combinations don't match exactly the listener's mood. Maybe, the relation itself about the content of the musics, and ir rithm within it, could be another way to understand the listener's habit and their relation with the music.
