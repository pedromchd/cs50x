                    <p>I started with Java (miecraft's fault), it didn't go well, so I gave up and after starting my highschool, I was able to learn a lot.</p>

                    <p>I'm also learning Japanese with Duolingo, I'm in a 168 day streak now!</p>
                    <p>I don't know how to play any specific instrument, but I would like to learn the violin and the piano!</p>
